# Room Cleaning
## Final project for EECS 442: Computer Vision
A cluttered environment can contribute to feelings of stress, anxiety, and lowered mood. 
The ability to quickly visualize a messy room as clean can be helpful for motivating someone to clean it up or motivate them to clean it up. 

For real estate, itâ€™s useful to remove unwanted items from scenes to help convince potential buyers or tenants more easily.


## Approach
1. Train an object detection model on images of messy rooms, identifying messy areas/objects.
2. Based on the parts of the room classified as clutter, create masks of the image.
3. Use inpainting to fill in the masked areas, removing all objects identified as clutter.
